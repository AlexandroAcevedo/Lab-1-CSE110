## My Coding Origin Story 
To begin I'd like to show my first ever snippet of code I've wrote. 


`print("I LOVE LEAGUEOFLEGENDS", 73)`


To me, this small snippet of code was a core memory because I had **never** even interacted with coding before other than the little scratch cat in 5th grade. So this silly one line of code I did during SEI was a eye opener to how fun I thought coding would be! I've of course learned a lot since then and now know that coding is a lot more than just silly one-liners. 

## Hobbies/Interests
In my spare time *cries* I like to read novels/comics, watch Eat the Menu with the TryGuys, collect figures(Dragon Ball, Cats, Marvel, etc), and play a bit of D&D! Recently however I've gotten into this web game [Pokerogue](https://pokerogue.net/) which is basically a roguelike version of pokemon!
